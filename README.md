This document focuses on studying Canadian households and their spending/saving habits. For this, two datasets have been provided by Environics Analytics:  • Household spending per dissemination area • Demographic data per dissemination area The analysis is divided into two Parts: unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction), and supervised learning (regression).  In the first part, we cleaned the data and used K-means clustering to recognize the distinct segments within the merged household spending and demographic dataset. The optimal number of clusters has been calculated by using the Elbow method and the Silhouette method. To further explore the structure of the dataset, we implemented the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).  The second part focuses on the development of models for predicting a household’s proportion of income spent on total personal insurance premiums and retirement/pension contributions. We employed two predictive models: elastic net linear regression and the XGBoost model. Both models were evaluated in terms of mean squared error (MSE), R-squared (R2) and bootstrapped confidence intervals, and XGBoost significantly outperformed the elastic net linear regression. Furthermore, we employed the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values method to identify the most important variables contributing to the household spending behavior.
